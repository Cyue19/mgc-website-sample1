                        The Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) focuses on unifying and creating opportunities for all of 
                        its member organizations. The MGC and its members work together in an on-going effort to serve as 
                        the governing body of the organizations approved for membership within the Multicultural Greek Council 
                        at the University of Virginia. The MGC educates and supports the current and emerging traditions of 
                        Greek-lettered organizations. The MGC unifies the goals and ideals of member organizations in relation 
                        to the educational mission of the University of Virginia. The MGC cooperates with the members of the 
                        Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), the Inter-Sorority Council (ISC), and the National Pan-Hellenic Council 
                        (NPHC). The MGC educates the UVA community of Multicultural Greek Council's purpose and the pillars of its 
                        organizations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the organizations of the Multicultural Greek Council sponsor or co-sponsor educational 
                        programs regarding hazing, discrimination, and personal safety. All member organizations stress their commitment 
                        to the University and Charlottesville communities. Informational sessions about the fraternities and sororities 
                        are held throughout the year.

                    <p>
                        The Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) at the University of Virginia was founded in the spring of 1999 in order to 
                        unite Greek-lettered organizations that promote culture. The founding members were representatives of Omega Phi Beta 
                        Sorority, Incorporated, alpha Kappa Delta Phi Sorority, Incorporated, and La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda 
                        Fraternity, Incorporated. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Council exists in order to educate and support the expressions of Greek-lettered 
                        organizations and to promote the fraternity and sorority ideals of scholarship, leadership, service, culture, and 
                        brotherhood or sisterhood. The MGC also cooperates with members of the Inter-Fraternity Council, the Inter-Sorority 
                        Council, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council and educates them on the purpose of the MGC.
